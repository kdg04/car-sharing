There are all the individual 7 questions as separate modules (Part1 Q1 ... Q7) and a complete module assignment_part1 that removes the common codes of all these individual modules to integrate into one complete program. (this is the same code as in individual modules but packed together though not tested but should work fine). There is a utility program CarSharingDB to read the contents of the database 'CarSharing' that has many tables created as the modules execute, the main one primarily being 'Car_Sharing' table though tere are others like weather, time and so on... To check for the contents of these tables, use the program readCarSharingDB and change the name of the table (as here it is 'Car_Sharing') in this line to the table of your choice to read/evaluate the contents of the table desired.
              cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Car_sharing")
To build your database, start with the executions of the modules in increasing order from Q! to Q7. The necessary tables get created in successive modules. The main database 'CarSharing' will be created after the execution of the first module `Part1 Q1`.
